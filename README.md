Hello!

My first steps in C:

All Code: branch develop

  four.c - Geron (float area(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int x3, int y3);)
  
  revers.c - Writing a natural number in reverse order, without using a loop (example: 654321 -> 123456; 1002 - > 2001);

  min2time.c - converting a natural number to a clock (appearance: 00:00; 24:00 -> 00:00; 2024 -> 09:44);

  center_of_the_rectangle.c - Find the center of the rectangle by the upper left and lower right points (It is guaranteed that this will be a point in integer coordinates).
